### ðŸ¤– AI & Machine Learning Integration
The application's core intelligence is powered by two machine learning methods:
* **Regression:** Used to forecast spending trends over time based on historical data. This helps predict when a user is likely to have high expenditures, allowing for better financial preparation. It also estimates the time needed to achieve a savings goal by analyzing income and spending patterns.
* **Decision Tree:** Used to subjectively categorize user spending into `high`, `moderate`, or `low` based on various conditions and variables, providing users with a clearer understanding of their spending habits.
